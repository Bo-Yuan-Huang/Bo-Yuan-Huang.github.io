				<p>
					I am a research scientist at Intel Offensive Security Research. My work focuses on design methodology and automated verification of digital computing systems. A central theme of my research is leveraging formal methods (especially in modeling, verification, and synthesis) to ensure system correctness and security. Before joining Intel, I received my B.S. from National Taiwan University and my M.A. and Ph.D. from Princeton University.

				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>HACK@EVENT</strong>
					<em>(Intel, Synopsys, Texas AMU, and TU Darmstadt)</em><br>
					<span class="image projlogo"><img src="images/projects/hack.png" alt="" /></span>
					The HACK@EVENT franchise is a first-of-its-kind hardware security contest held in conjunction with top security and system venues such as USENIX Security, DAC, and CHES. The goal is to foster a broader security mindset and develop the next generation of hardware security experts through boosting community open-sourcing and facilitating research in automatic tools and verification techniques.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>UPSCALE</strong>
					<em>(Stanford University and Princeton University)</em><br>
					<span class="image projlogo"><img src="images/projects/upscale.png" alt="" /></span>
					The UPSCALE project is funded within the DARPA Posh Open Source Hardware (POSH) program. The goal is to develop open-source tools and techniques for verifying and evaluating heterogeneous hardware computing systems. It uses different levels of abstraction&mdash;instruction-level interfaces for processors and accelerators, circuit-level models for analog/mixed-signal components, and RTL FSM for other digital modules.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>3LA</strong>
					<em>(Princeton University, U. of Washington, and Harvard University)</em><br>
					<span class="image projlogo"><img src="images/projects/3la.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					The 3LA project is funded by the Applications Driving Architectures Center (ADA). The goal is to develop a "plug-and-play" ecosystem for software and hardware development in heterogeneous computer systems. Specifically, we developed an end-to-end verification/validation framework for accelerators and a DSL compiling flow to provide platform portability and allow optimization via standard compiler flows.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Project OneFuzz</strong>
					<em>(Microsoft Research)</em><br>
					<span class="image projlogo"><img src="images/projects/onefuzz.png" alt="" /></span>
					OneFuzz is a cross-platform open-source fuzzing framework by Microsoft. The goal is to enable continuous developer-driven fuzzing to harden software security proactively. Among its ventures, RESTler is the first stateful REST API fuzzer that efficiently find security and reliability bugs in cloud services.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Security Risk Detection</strong>
					<em>(Microsoft Research)</em><br>
					The Microsoft Security Risk Detection Service (MSRD) is the first “fuzzing-as-a-service” offering, providing users with a premium software testing experience, searching for vulnerabilities in native code with the power of MSR‘s Scalable Automated Guided Execution (SAGE) tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Instruction-Level Abstraction</strong>
					<em>(Princeton University)</em><br>
					<span class="image projlogo"><img src="images/projects/ilang.png" alt="" /></span>
					The Instruction-Level Abstraction (ILA) provides a software/hardware interface that generalizes the notion of ISAs to accelerators. This project investigates the uses of ILA in modeling, verification, and the automation of software and hardware in heterogeneous computing systems, such as firmware verification, memory-consistency reasoning, protocol verification, and equivalence/refinement checking of RTL implementation.
